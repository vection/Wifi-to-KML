# Wifi sampeling manipulations
As part of OOP course we had to build step by step software which reads data (in our case is Wifi sampels) from csv file (well orginized form) and there are few options to use this data.
Input is wiggle wifi output CSV format with wifi samples divided by colums.
Our data represent wifi samples which contains FirstSeen, MAC,RSSI,SSID,CurrentLongitude.CurrentLatitude,Channel,AltitudeMeters,ID
We can read from csv,write to csv,write to KML,sort by longtitude,altitude,time and signal rate. 
Option to sort by range/by device.
MYSQL database available.
Also 2 algorithms - finding the weight of couple of samples and also re-estimating the exact location of wifi spot by 3 highest samples.
Grpahics also available with simple API and statistics.
